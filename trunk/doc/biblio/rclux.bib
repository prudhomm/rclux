  abstract = {Mathematical models of the response of populations of microorganisms
	exposed to ultraviolet
	
	germicidal irradiation (UVGI) are developed that include two-stage
	response curves and shoulder
	
	effects. Models are used to develop a C++ computer program that is
	capable of predicting the
	
	performance of UVGI air disinfection systems. The algorithms are based
	on models for 1) the
	
	intensity field of UVGI lamps, 2) the intensity field due to UVGI
	reflective enclosures, and 3) the
	
	kill rate of microorganisms to UVGI exposure as they pass through
	the modeled intensity field.
	
	The validity of the UVGI lamp model is established by comparison with
	lamp photosensor data.
	
	The validity of the overall predictive model is established by comparison
	of predictions with
	
	laboratory bioassays for two species of airborne pathogens â€“ Serratia
	marcescens and Bacillus
	
	subtilis. First stage rate constants, second stage rate constants,
	and the defining shoulder
	
	parameters are determined for Aspergillus niger and Rhizopus nigricans
	based on bioassay data,
	
	and it is shown how predictions using only single stage rate constants
	can deviate significantly
	
	from predictions using the complete survival curve. A dimensional
	analysis of UVGI systems
	
	identifies nine dimensionless parameters responsible for determining
	the effectiveness of any
	
	rectangular UVGI system. A factorial analysis of the dimensionless
	parameters based on data
	
	output by the program identifies the most critical parameters and
	the inter-relationships that
	
	determine UVGI system effectiveness. Response surfaces are generated
	using program output to
	
	illustrate the inter-relationships of the dimensionless parameters.
	The optimum values of the
	
	dimensionless parameters are summarized that result in optimized performance.
	Economic
	
	optimization is demonstrated by a series of examples that calculate
	life cycle costs, and principles
	
	of economic optimization are summarized. Conclusions are presented
	that will produce more
	
	energy-efficient and effective designs and a proposed model for improved
	UVGI systems is
	
	presented.},

  abstract = {A comprehensive treatment of the mathematical basis for modeling the
	disinfection process for air using ultraviolet germicidal irradiation
	(UVGI). A complete mathematical description of the survival curve
	is developed that incorporates both a two stage inactivation curve
	and a shoulder. A methodology for the evaluation of the three-dimensional
	intensity fields around UV lamps and within reflective enclosures
	is summarized that will enable determination of the UV dose absorbed
	by aerosolized microbes. The results of past UVGI studies on airborne
	pathogens are tabulated. The airborne rate constant for Bacillus
	subtilis is confirmed based on results of an independent test. A
	re-evaluation of data from several previous studies demonstrates
	the application of the shoulder and two-stage models. The methods
	presented here will enable accurate interpretation of experimental
	results involving aerosolized microorganisms exposed to UVGI and
	associated relative humidity effects},
